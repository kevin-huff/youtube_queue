Frank Zappa tried to interest United Artists, the company that released 200 Motels, but they declined. Other studios followed United Artists' lead, fearing that Zappa's \"cinematic style\" had lost considerable appeal in 70s pop culture, and also declined to distribute the film.\n\nSeveral European distributors told Zappa that there might be interest if the running time was cut from its original 168-minute length. The film was cut to 90 minutes, but still, there were no takers.\n\nEven after Bruce Bickford's sequences won first prize at a French animated film competition, there was no interest. Eventually Zappa took it upon himself to distribute the film independently, via his own production company, Intercontinental Absurdities. The film ran 24 hours a day at the Victoria Theater in New York City. (This can be clearly seen in the opening credits to the film, \"Eaten Alive,\" partly filmed in New York at the time Baby Snakes was playing.

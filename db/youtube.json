I was unable to find one.  So I decided to make it myself.\n\nThe ideal would be a full-length theme song.  I've never heard that one has ever been made.  So I made that myself as well, here.  It would have been much better to have Tina Fabrique singing a second & third verse.  But without having that, I used what's available.\n\nTina sings a short acapella version here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-EkXxQ1dJg&t=1m8s\n...and this audio clip was used as a bridge to repeats of the chorus.\n\nThe visuals have been extended by plugging in the last version of the tv intro.  As I understand it, it was a version which was first used ~2000.\n\nI hope a proper full-length song was recorded.  With extra verses.  And that it's just hiding somewhere.  If that exists, and ever comes to light, then we can look at remaking this music video.\n\nCopyright belongs to the owner of the song and the visuals.  I do not own anything here.\n\nThe regular one minute tv intro is here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw_WV6Cg_Ys\nIt is the best quality version that I am aware of.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OAIW5se_cxg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OAIW5se_cxg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OAIW5se_cxg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OAIW5se_cxg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OAIW5se_cxg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Da Hawk","categoryId":"25","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Reading Rainbow (Extended tv series theme song, sung by Tina Fabrique)","description":"I scoured the interwebs looking to find a top quality clip of this well-loved PBS tv series hosted by LeVar Burton.  I was unable to find one.  So I decided to make it myself.\n\nThe ideal would be a full-length theme song.  I've never heard that one has ever been made.  So I made that myself as well, here.  It would have been much better to have Tina Fabrique singing a second & third verse.  But without having that, I used what's available.\n\nTina sings a short acapella version here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-EkXxQ1dJg&t=1m8s\n...and this audio clip was used as a bridge to repeats of the chorus.\n\nThe visuals have been extended by plugging in the last version of the tv intro.  As I understand it, it was a version which was first used ~2000.\n\nI hope a proper full-length song was recorded.  With extra verses.  And that it's just hiding somewhere.  If that exists, and ever comes to light, then we can look at remaking this music video.\n\nCopyright belongs to the owner of the song and the visuals.

So, guess what? The dragon decided to borrow the deer to fill in for his lunch. You can see the Komodo’s digging inside the deer’s belly to pull chunks of meat out of there. The deer is dead, but it wasn’t when they began eating.  Komodo dragons are more active in the morning because Komodo dragons are cold-blooded animals. Usually, during the rainy season, deer are more active and present at beaches. This deer was trying to enjoy a moment at the beach when a couple of Komodo lifeguards tried to save it from the water, so they could eat it.  A male Komodo monitors a deer that had been injured by a bite a few days earlier and continues to follow the deer. When the deer begins to get sick from the bacterial infection, the Komodo decides it’s time to kill and eat the deer. The deer tries running away, but the Komodo remains latched on to it. A small Komodo approaches a young deer, and the deer tries stomping on the Komodo when another Komodo shows up and they corner the deer. A larger animal standing there doesn’t even pay attention to the two Komodo’s. The small deer hides behind the big animal, so the Komodo’s don’t get close to it, but how long is that going to last? \n\nKomodo VS Monkey\n\nA Komodo catches a monkey but doesn’t want to share it with his friend, so he runs off in a jiffy to eat it alone. I’m not sure the other Komodo is going to agree with this. I didn’t know dragons were so selfish. I always see them share dinners together. This monkey hits the jackpot when four dragons are vying for its attention. The only problem is they’re all starving and want a piece of him.  Monkeys that fall from trees are swallowed by Komodos. The Komodo dragon ambushed and swallowed one of the monkeys who fell while struggling for the territory. It’s unfortunate for the monkey, but I guess that’s how the wheel of life turns.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1uDU8IfBv2E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1uDU8IfBv2E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1uDU8IfBv2E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1uDU8IfBv2E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1uDU8IfBv2E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Fanatic","tags":["The Komodo Dragon Eating Everything In Sight","komodo","animals","dragon","komodo dragon","lizard","reptile","wild","top animals","animals vs","eat alive","komodo dragon attack","eaten alive","komodo dragons","komodo dragon hunting","komodo dragon eating","prey","predator","eating alive","komodo island","komodo eating","komodo eat alive","komododragon","eatingdeer","komododragoneating","komodohunting","brutal kill","brutal hunt","unbelievable footage","dragons eat alive","komodo dragon bite","eating lizard"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"The Komodo Dragon Eating Everything In Sight","description":"Komodo dragons are the world's largest living lizards, and they have some fascinating skills and characteristics that might pique your interest.
